# Context API

The Context API is a component structure provided by the React framework, which enables us to share specific forms of data across all levels of the application. It’s aimed at solving the problem of prop drilling.

“Prop drilling (also called “threading”) refers to the process you have to go through to get data to parts of the React Component tree.” 

Before the Context API, we could use a module to solve this, which led to the increasing popularity of state management libraries like Redux. Libraries like Redux allows you to get data from the store easily, anywhere in the tree. However, let’s focus on the Context API


## how to use

as have mentioned before we use context API to send the data without middel ware to use it you have to install it then declare what you want to share then where it will be used and the context will manage every thing to get it works
