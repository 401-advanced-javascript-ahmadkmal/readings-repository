# class 11 - Authentication

the internet have alot of web site that user need to sign in to use it so the user enter his email and password wich is secret informaition and maybe there is more informaion the user may consider it as a secret information so he need to know this information will be safe and will not be misuesd from here the doveopler start to think how the could keep this enformation safe 

## Cryptography

it is way to keep information safe by decoding it befor it send and no one can read it unless he have the key 

## Hash Algorithms

this way use some algrethem to decode the secret info then the data will be stored without decode that will make the data hashed even if someone access the data base.

after that every time user want to access the website and want to send the password the same algorethm will applay and the sended hashed data will be comber with the hashed one in the database 

## Cypher Algorithms

use data with key this key is only for this data and it need the same key to decoded 

## Basic Authorization

it will send the user and the password in http with this format username:pass
then this data will have a key that key used to login or to present this info
