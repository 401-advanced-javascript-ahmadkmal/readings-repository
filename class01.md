# IT Ecosystem

An IT ecosystem is "the network of organizations that drives the creation and delivery of information technology products and services.

Technology ecosystems are product platforms defined by core components made by the platform owner and complemented by applications made by autonomous companies in the periphery.
These ecosystems offer solutions comprising a larger system of use than the original platform owner created and solve an important technical problems within in an industry.
In successful technology ecosystems it is easy to connect to or build upon the core solution in order to expand the system of use and allow new and even unanticipated end uses.
The core firm's product has important but limited value when used alone but substantially increases in value when used with the complementary applications.
Forrester's concept of an IT ecosystem is much more comprehensive. The CIO is no longer just responsible for leading the "IT department." He or she is responsible for managing relationships within an "ecosystem" comprising three types of participants:

Consumers: the end-customers and users of technology within the organization.
Producers: the technology vendors, including both product and service providers
Influencers: the key stakeholders within the business that have an increasing voice over the direction and role of IT.
The boundaries between participants in the IT ecosystem are becoming less definite, leading to many interesting complications in the role of the CIO today.

## Node.js

Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform, JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting—running scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm, unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server- and client-side scripts.

## v8

V8 is Google’s open source high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, written in C++. It is used in Chrome and in Node.js, among others. It implements ECMAScript and WebAssembly, and runs on Windows 7 or later, macOS 10.12+, and Linux systems that use x64, IA-32, ARM, or MIPS processors. V8 can run standalone, or can be embedded into any C++ application.

## modules

Consider modules to be the same as JavaScript libraries.

A set of functions you want to include in your application.

## package

A package is a file or directory that is described by a package.json file. A package must contain a package.json file in order to be published to the npm registry.

Packages can be unscoped or scoped to a user or Org, and scoped packages can be private or public.

## npm

npm (originally short for Node Package Manager) is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. It is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of a command line client, also called npm, and an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. The registry is accessed via the client, and the available packages can be browsed and searched via the npm website. The package manager and the registry are managed by npm, Inc.

## server

a server is a computer program or a device that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". This architecture is called the client–server model, and a single overall computation is distributed across multiple processes or devices. Servers can provide various functionalities, often called "services", such as sharing data or resources among multiple clients, or performing computation for a client. A single server can serve multiple clients, and a single client can use multiple servers. A client process may run on the same device or may connect over a network to a server on a different device. Typical servers are database servers, file servers, mail servers, print servers, web servers, game servers, and application servers.

## environment

An  environment is an integrated
collection of technology components that
serves the needs of its users and the
owner of the resulting system.
– System – a set of things that work together as
part of a greater mechanism

## Interpreter Versus Compiler

An interpreter translates high-level instructions into an intermediate form, which it then executes. In contrast, a compiler translates high-level instructions directly into machine language. Compiled programs generally run faster than interpreted programs. The advantage of an interpreter, however, is that it does not need to go through the compilation stage during which machine instructions are generated. This process can be time-consuming if the program is long. The interpreter, on the other hand, can immediately execute high-level programs.
