# Thunking for Data

is a process that happen before you call action and that may help you to mange data or even to get data from api


## dispatch(action)

Dispatches an action. This is the only way to trigger a state change.

The store's reducing function will be called with the current getState() result and the given action synchronously. Its return value will be considered the next state. It will be returned from getState() from now on, and the change listeners will immediately be notified.

``` js

import { createStore } from 'redux'
const store = createStore(todos, ['Use Redux'])

function addTodo(text) {
  return {
    type: 'ADD_TODO',
    text
  }
}

store.dispatch(addTodo('Read the docs'))
store.dispatch(addTodo('Read about the middleware'))

```
