# React Testing and Deployment

## testing

there is terminology that you can use to test your react app :

- Snapshots - Make assertions on the exact rendered markup (with content) at any state of the application.
- Render Testing - Similar to snapshots, but allows for jQuery-like inspection of the virtual DOM 
- treeShallow Testing - Executes and renders the called/container component, but does not compose 
- children.Mounting - Executes the full component and children. Allows for inspection of rendered Virtual DOM as well as the current state

## deployment

 to deploy your react app you can use git hub or AWS s3 AWS amplifyand Netlify
