# React Native

## What is native development?

A native app is one that is installed directly onto the smartphone and can work, in most cases, with no internet connectivity depending on the nature of the app. Native apps are installed through an application store (such as Google Play or Apple’s App Store). They are developed specifically for one platform, and can take full advantage of the device features — they can work much faster by harnessing the power of the processor and can access specific hardware like GPS.  In some smartphones the app can control devices and act as a controller itself. They can also incorporate gestures (either standard operating-system gestures or new, app-defined gestures). And native apps can use the device’s notification system.

## Why is it important to develop a native app vs a responsive react app?

it will give the user better experience and he sometimes will not need to have internet connection
