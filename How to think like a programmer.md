# How to think like a programmer

the main action programing do is to code and every code have it is prepuse
every code solve some preoblem or help some people and to think as programmer you have to solve this problem and here is some steeps that may help you to sollve a problem as programmer

## Understand

Know exactly what is being asked. Most hard problems are hard because you don’t understand them (hence why this is the first step)

## Plan

Don’t dive right into solving without a plan (and somehow hope you can muddle your way through). Plan your solution!

## Divide

Instead, break it into sub-problems. These sub-problems are much easier to solve.

## waht if you stuck

First off, take a deep breath. Second, that’s fair.

Don’t worry though, friend. This happens to everyone!

The difference is the best programmers/problem-solvers are more curious about bugs/errors than irritated.

1-Debug: Go step by step through your solution trying to find where you went wrong. Programmers call this debugging (in fact, this is all a debugger does).
2-Reassess: Take a step back. Look at the problem from another perspective. Is there anything that can be abstracted to a more general approach?
3-Research: Ahh, good ol’ Google. You read that right. No matter what problem you have, someone has probably solved it. Find that person/ solution. In fact, do this even if you solved the problem! (You can learn a lot from other people’s solutions).
