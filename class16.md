# class16 Event Driven Applications 

## event

so if we want to talk about en=ven on programming we should know the hall concept of it the event used in real life and help us to deal with live-action so for example when someone call your name you mind will take it as a process to make an event in your mind and make you deal with that interrupt that is the use of event in another world, we can say even if a multi of action that will happen on specific external input happen 


## event in programming

as the event happen in real life they are used in machine or in application also, so let us see some example of it if we want to talk about machine then we may think of at as machine in the industry that will respond to do something when something happen like stop the machine and fill the cup when the cup in that place

in programming, we also use it in a similar way which is many when someone add something work to do multi of action
